# PROJECT: THE GALACTIC EXPENSE & MISSION TRACKER

### 🚀 Overview

A CLI-based mission control system designed to manage space exploration resources. This project focuses on Python’s core logic, data structures, and mathematical computations.

### 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

- **Data Structures:** Lists (Cargo), Tuples (Coordinates), Sets (Planet Registry), Dictionaries (Crew Roles).
- **Logic:** Nested If...Else, While Loops for countdowns, For Loops with Range.
- **Math:** Casting string inputs to floats, using the `math` module for sensor calculations, and complex operators for fuel consumption.
- **Functions:** Modular code for blast-off sequences and resource checks.
- **File Handling:** Programmatic creation (Write), reading, and deletion of inventory files.
- **Data Exchange:** Importing the `json` module to parse and format product metadata.
- **Control Flow:** Using Python 3.10+ `match-case` for menu navigation and command processing.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing `try...except` blocks to prevent crashes during arithmetic and file operations.
- **System & Dates:** Using the `datetime` module for audit timestamps and `os` for file system cleanup.

### 📋 Task Roadmap

- **Task 1-3:** Initialize ship status (Fuel, Engine, Rations) using Casting and f-strings.
- **Task 4-7:** Organize mission data using Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
- **Task 8-11:** Execute flight logic using Math modules, Comparison Operators, and Loop control.
- **Task 12-14:** Implement safety checks with Booleans and capture User Input for destinations.
- **Task 15-16:** Setup audit timestamps and implement Error Handling for data calculations.
- **Task 17-18:** Perform File I/O operations (Creating and Reading `inventory.txt`).
- **Task 19:** Convert Python dictionaries into JSON strings for external reporting.
- **Task 20:** Build a command processor using Match-Case and finalize with File Deletion logic.
