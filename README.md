# AI Engineering Journey

This repository documents my complete journey toward becoming a professional AI Engineer.

It contains structured learning, hands on projects, experiments, notes, and implementations covering everything from beginner Python fundamentals to advanced AI systems and backend development.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Master Python from beginner to advanced level
- Build strong foundations in data structures and algorithms
- Learn backend development with FastAPI
- Understand databases and system design
- Explore machine learning and deep learning
- Build real world AI applications
- Develop production ready coding practices

This is not just theory. Every concept is backed by implementation.
